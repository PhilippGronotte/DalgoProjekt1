The motivation of the semester project is to use the discussed content of the course 'Daten und Algorithmik'. Although we need the Creditpoints as well.

Installation
-------------------------------
<p> Download all the files manually in one directory and run 'GUI.m' in Matlab. That's it.</p>

<p>A second possibility is to clone our Git-repository from the following link:</p>

Project
-------------------------------
### Essentials

The project includes following files:

- GUI.m
- getweatherxml.m
- cell2vec.m
- wetterplots.m
- Tagesanzeige.m

After the first execution you will also find a file called:

- weather.xml

in the chosen programm directory.

The programm updates it's weather data from www.wunderground.com. A working internet conection is necessary for that reason.
